obstacles -

- Laser Paddle - fires lasers that if hit the ball changes its trajectory
- Topspin
- Backspin
- Cut n Paste - Steal someone elses powerup, upon activation ball freezes and allows player to select one of the other player's powerups, maybe just get 4 random powerups from the players, and you push up down left or right, or selects at random from the available powerups stored in somebodies array

#Defensive Powerups
- Invulnerability/Immunity
- Grow Paddle
- Sticky paddle

- shrink & enlarge board
- multiball
- shadow multiball - half the balls are shadows, others
- Accelerate Ball
